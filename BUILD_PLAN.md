# PROJECT BUILD PLAN & STATE

**Status:** Living. This file updates as stages complete. Frozen design decisions live in `DECISIONS.md` — read that first, then this.

**How to use (each chat):**
1. Read `DECISIONS.md`, then this file.
2. Find the current stage under "Current State."
3. Build exactly that stage's scope — no more. One stage per working session where practical; large stages split into their sub-stages.
4. Produce runnable artifacts (code/config/schema), not descriptions.
5. Verify per the stage's verification location. Report observed behavior verbatim; do not soften failures.
6. On completion, update this file: mark the stage done, advance Current State, append to the Change Log.

**Update rules:**
- This file changes; `DECISIONS.md` does not (unless the user reopens a decision).
- Never mark a stage done without its Definition of Done met.
- "Code-here, validate-on-hardware" stages are *done here* when the code/config is complete and structurally verified; they carry a pending hardware-validation flag until the user confirms on the target machine.

---

## BUILD ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS

The build sandbox has **no GPU and no bundled model weights.** Consequences:

- **Verifiable here:** data schemas, file formats, UI logic, management logic, memory store/retrieval logic, decay-model logic, filter/blocklist logic, compositing logic, packaging structure. Anything that does not require running a model on a GPU.
- **Code-here, validate-on-hardware:** anything invoking the image model or the LLM, LoRA training, embedding generation with the production model, live model-swapping, and the final packaged offline run. These stages produce complete, structurally-verified code and configuration; final validation is on the user's 16 GB target machine.

Each stage below is tagged **[HERE]** or **[HARDWARE]** accordingly. Some stages are mixed and say so.

**Safety is not a stage.** It is woven through the spine:
- Layer 1 (deterministic filter) is built in Stage 0 and *wraps every input/output* as later stages add them.
- The 20+ hard gate (Layer 3) lands *with* the data model in Stage 1.
- Image-side Layer 1 + Layer 2 attach across Stage 3.
- Chat-side Layer 2 + Layer 4 attach in Stage 6.
- The content-line policy is drafted in Stage 0 and must exist before any generation stage (3, 5, 6e).

---

## STAGES

### Stage 0 — Scaffold + Safety Foundation  **[HERE]**
**Goal:** App skeleton and the deterministic safety layer everything routes through.
**Depends on:** nothing.
**Produces:**
- App folder structure + launcher stub + single-window shell (no console, no extra windows).
- Config/settings system, including the model-swap toggle scaffold (image + chat model selection).
- **Layer-1 deterministic filter module:** reusable input/output wrapper — blocklists, regex/classifier gates for prohibited categories, name slur-block. Built as a standalone module other stages import.
- **Content-line policy draft** (permitted vs prohibited), for user approval. Gates all generation stages.
**Definition of done:** shell launches to one window; settings persist; filter module rejects known bad inputs and passes clean ones in isolation tests; content-line draft delivered and approved by user.
**Safety attached:** Layer 1 (created), Layer 4 logging scaffold, content-line draft.

---

### Stage 1 — Character Data Model + Schemas  **[HERE]**
**Goal:** The record shape everything else reads and writes.
**Depends on:** Stage 0.
**Produces:**
- Character record schema: structured tag fields + filtered free-text fields + categorical anatomy fields + identity-anchor state (`has-LoRA`, reference image path, LoRA path, catalog manifest, footprint).
- **Option-definition data-file format** (§15): races, outfits, traits, anatomy categories, etc. — the format that makes options addable without a rebuild.
- Persistence layer (character records + catalog manifests on disk).
- **20+ hard gate (Layer 3):** age has no sub-20 representation and validates as a hard gate — under-20 is unconstructable.
- Name field wired to the Stage-0 slur-block (Layer 1).
**Definition of done:** a character record round-trips to disk and back; option data-files load and are enumerable; attempting a sub-20 character is structurally impossible (not merely rejected); a slur in the name field is blocked.
**Safety attached:** Layer 3 (age), Layer 1 (name).

---

### Stage 2 — Creator UI  **[HERE]**
**Goal:** The interface that writes character records. Rendering not yet wired.
**Depends on:** Stage 1.
**Produces:**
- **Quick-create** (minimal path — IP-Adapter target).
- **Detailed-create** (full path): progressive-disclosure, region-grouped anatomy; tags + filtered free text for backstory/personality; selection widgets (dropdowns/radials/wheels/segmented); sliders reserved for height/weight/muscle only.
- Categorical anatomy selectors (§12).
- Free-text fields routed through the Stage-0 Layer-1 filter (Layer 2 applies later, at generation).
- Reads option data-files (Stage 1); writes character records (Stage 1).
**Definition of done:** both create paths produce valid character records; anatomy is categorical with reserved sliders only where specified; adding a new option data-file surfaces new choices in the creator without code change; all free-text passes through Layer 1.
**Safety attached:** Layer 1 on all free-text input.

---

### Stage 3 — Image Pipeline  **[HARDWARE]** (highest risk; split)
**Goal:** Turn a character record into a consistent visual catalog.
**Depends on:** Stage 2 (a saved record to render).
**Safety across all sub-stages:** image-prompt Layer 1 at 3a; Layer 2 (negative prompts + content classifier) across 3a–3g; content-line policy must be approved before starting.

- **3a — Base generation.** Record → structured prompt → SDXL-derived model call. *Done here:* code + config complete and structurally sound. *Hardware:* produces a coherent image from a record. **DONE-HERE 2026-07-10 (hardware-validation flag PENDING).**
- **3b — IP-Adapter baseline identity.** Reference image → steered generation for immediate consistency (quick-create path). **DONE-HERE 2026-07-11 (hardware-validation flag PENDING).**
- **3c — Identity bootstrap + auto-filter.** Single strong reference → seed batch → face-embedding cull (ArcFace/InsightFace) + quality score → optional face-swap identity lock → small vetted grid for user confirmation. (§6) **DONE-HERE 2026-07-11 (hardware-validation flag PENDING).**
- **3d — LoRA promotion.** Train identity LoRA on the ~15–30 vetted set. Heavier/quality-max settings authorized. **DONE-HERE 2026-07-11 (hardware-validation flag PENDING).**
- **3e — Seed catalog generation.** Core matrix (expressions × poses × outfits) via the LoRA. (§7) **DONE-HERE 2026-07-11 (hardware-validation flag PENDING).**
- **3f — Matting / keyable output.** Background removal (or keyable-background generation) so frames composite cleanly. (§13) — **Stage 5 depends on this.** **DONE-HERE 2026-07-12 (hardware-validation flag PENDING).**
- **3g — On-demand generation + cache.** Novel states generate on demand, auto-filter, cache into the growing per-character library. (§7)

**Definition of done (stage):** each sub-stage's code + config complete and structurally verified here; on hardware, the full path produces a consistent catalog for a test character with identity holding across the core matrix, and on-demand frames cache and matte correctly. Hardware-validation flag stays pending until the user confirms.

---

### Stage 4 — Library & Management  **[HERE]** (regeneration triggers depend on Stage 3 on hardware)
**Goal:** Manage saved characters and their catalogs.
**Depends on:** Stage 1 (records), Stage 3 (catalogs exist to manage).
**Produces:**
- View / sort / filter / edit.
- Edit → **offers** regeneration + **marks catalog stale** (§14).
- Per-character footprint display (LoRA + catalog + cached frames).
- Deletion recommendation past threshold + **automatic LRU cap** backstop (evicted frames regenerate on demand). (§14)
**Definition of done:** characters list/sort/filter; editing marks stale and offers (not forces) regeneration; footprint displays accurately; LRU cap evicts correctly and the recommendation surfaces at threshold. (Actual regeneration invocation validated on hardware via Stage 3.)
**Safety attached:** none new.

---

### Stage 5 — Scene / Persona / Scenario / Event Builders  **[HERE]** + **[HARDWARE]** for rendering
**Goal:** User-authored context to interact within, plus scene imagery.
**Depends on:** Stage 1 (builder record shape), Stage 3f (matting for compositing).
**Produces:**
- Lighter structured builder (tags + filtered free text) for personas/scenes/events/scenarios (§13).
- Background generation via the same image pipeline (**[HARDWARE]**).
- **Character-over-background compositing** using matted frames from 3f (compositing logic **[HERE]**).
- Background on/off toggle.
**Definition of done:** builders produce valid records via the same input model; compositing places a matted character frame over a generated background cleanly with the toggle working (compositing logic verified here; background generation validated on hardware).
**Safety attached:** Layer 1 on builder free-text; Layer 2 on background generation.

---

### Stage 6 — Chat Loop  **[HARDWARE]** (memory/decay/selection logic partly **[HERE]**; split)
**Goal:** Interact with characters; persistent human-like memory; avatar updates with conversation.
**Depends on:** Stages 1–5.
**Safety across:** Layer 2 (system-prompt boundaries + refusal) at 6d; Layer 4 logging across chat + generation; explicit attention to the manipulation-toward-prohibited-outcome category at 6d + Layer 4 review (§11).

- **6a — Model load/swap manager.** Chat ↔ image, **sequenced** to avoid VRAM contention (§9). Code **[HERE]**; swap behavior **[HARDWARE]**.
- **6b — RAG memory store.** Per-character embed/store/retrieve/rank. Store/retrieve/rank logic **[HERE]**; production embedding **[HARDWARE]**.
- **6c — Decay model.** Metadata (recency/salience/reinforcement), scoring function, exposed knobs, toggle-off → plain RAG (§9). Logic **[HERE]**; tuning **[HARDWARE]** against real conversation.
- **6d — Persona injection + turn assembly.** Traits + retrieved memories + rolling window → prompt. **[HARDWARE]** for live generation.
- **6e — Avatar-frame selection.** Map conversation state → catalog frame; miss → on-demand via 3g. Selection logic **[HERE]**; generation **[HARDWARE]**.
**Definition of done:** swap manager sequences correctly (verified here; timing on hardware); memory store/retrieve/rank and decay scoring behave correctly in isolation with knobs exposed and toggle working; on hardware, a multi-turn conversation shows persistent memory, correct forgetting behavior after tuning, and an avatar that updates from the catalog with on-demand fallback. Manipulation-category handling reviewed.
**Safety attached:** Layer 2 (chat), Layer 4 (logging).

---

### Stage 7 — Packaging  **[HARDWARE]** (final offline run on target machine)
**Goal:** Assemble the shippable single-launch app folder.
**Depends on:** all prior stages.
**Produces:**
- Single-launch app-folder assembly (§2).
- Model/weight bundling.
- One-window wrapper — no console, no additional windows.
- Offline verification (no network calls).
**Definition of done (final):** on the target machine, double-click launches to one window, fully offline, no stray windows/console; a character can be created, cataloged, managed, and chatted with end-to-end. This is the final acceptance test and happens on the user's hardware.
**Safety attached:** full stack present and active.

---

## CURRENT STATE

**Current stage:** Stage 3 — Image Pipeline. **3a–3f done-here; 3g next**
(on-demand generation + cache — novel states generate on demand, auto-filter,
and cache into the growing per-character library, §7).
**Completed stages:** Stage 0 — Scaffold + Safety Foundation (**DONE** 2026-07-10);
Stage 1 — Character Data Model + Schemas (**DONE** 2026-07-10);
Stage 2 — Creator UI (**DONE** 2026-07-10);
Stage 3a — Base generation (**DONE-HERE** 2026-07-10; **hardware-VALIDATED** 2026-07-12);
Stage 3b — IP-Adapter baseline identity (**DONE-HERE** 2026-07-11; **hardware-VALIDATED** 2026-07-12);
Stage 3c — Identity bootstrap + auto-filter (**DONE-HERE** 2026-07-11; **hardware MOSTLY-VALIDATED** 2026-07-12 post-CCIP-swap — two named items remain, see pending flags);
Stage 3d — LoRA promotion (**DONE-HERE** 2026-07-11; **hardware-VALIDATED** 2026-07-12);
Stage 3e — Seed catalog generation (**DONE-HERE** 2026-07-11; **hardware-VALIDATED** 2026-07-12);
Stage 3f — Matting / keyable output (**DONE-HERE** 2026-07-12; **hardware MOSTLY-VALIDATED** 2026-07-12 — two named residuals, see pending flags).
**Pending hardware-validation flags:**
- **Stage 3a** — **VALIDATED 2026-07-12** (all eight §6 items PASS: first
  render + VRAM 10.35 GB + sidecar/audit; offline generate proven under a
  hard socket block with `models/sdxl_config` + `pipeline_config_dir` now
  set; base same-seed re-render across a full release/reload pixel-identical;
  release → 0.01 GB resident).
- **Stage 3b** — **VALIDATED 2026-07-12** (all eight §8 items PASS on the RTX
  4070 Super 12 GB; see the change-log entry — scripted real-services runs,
  like the 3a first-render). Residual observations: `plus` at the global 0.55
  scale over-steers (color cast) — its advisory band is 0.3–0.6 with code
  default 0.45; the ArcFace/buffalo_l anime-face calibration finding gates 3c
  (below).
- **Stage 3c** — **MOSTLY VALIDATED 2026-07-12** after the user-approved
  CCIP embedder swap (§11 items 1–3, 6–8 PASS: full 64-batch bootstrap,
  100% keep-rate, similarity floor calibrated on the measured CCIP gap,
  unload-before-cull live at 0.01 GB resident, socket-blocked offline run,
  single-cv2 install, `confirm_vetted` → 20-frame vetted set readable by 3d;
  see the change-log entry). **REMAINING:** item 4's false-negative side —
  the safety-critical minor-appearance recall check needs a deliberately
  minor-appearing render caught + audited, a user-directed test (the
  false-positive side is validated: 0 false blocks across 64 adult frames);
  and item 5 face-swap (default OFF) — if ever enabled, note the buffalo_l
  stack's anime-style margin applies to ITS detector too.
- **Stage 3d** — **VALIDATED 2026-07-12** (all §13 items on the RTX 4070
  Super 12 GB: full 1600-step train 31.5 min, peak 9.86 GB, LoRA holds
  identity across the 3e matrix; three real contract catches fixed — toml
  `resolution` string, UTF-8 subprocess pipes, CLIP-tokenizer prewarm — plus
  the `network_train_unet_only` default; see the change-log entry).
- **Stage 3e** — **VALIDATED 2026-07-12** (§15: full 20-cell matrix with the
  trained LoRA, 20/20 kept, 287 s, VRAM peak 10.51 GB, per-generate scale
  honored; two catches — `peft` was never pinned (load_lora_weights refuses
  without it) and diffusers 0.39's kohya te1/te2 converter regression (now a
  UNet-only engine fallback + the UNet-only trainer default; see the
  change-log entry). Custom `lora_scale` values remain tune-at-will.
- **Stage 3f** — **MOSTLY VALIDATED** (2026-07-12 entries: constants parity
  bit-identical, offline, throughput ~1.1–1.2 s/frame CPU, idempotence — now
  re-confirmed on the REAL 20-frame LoRA catalog, 20/20 matted).
  **REMAINING:** edge-quality tuning over bright AND dark composite
  backgrounds (halo knobs / BiRefNet escalation — naturally lands with
  Stage-5 compositing), and the blocked-frame purge drill (needs a
  deliberately blocked frame — pairs with the 3c Layer-2 recall check,
  user-directed).

**Stage 2 DoD — all MET (378 tests passing; live-window scripted smoke ALL PASS):**
- Both create paths produce valid character records — quick (name/age +
  `quick`-flagged groups) and detailed (full sections, anatomy by region,
  free text) both persist via `CreatorService.create_character` →
  `CharacterRecord.create` (hard gates re-run) → `CharacterStore.save`;
  round-trip + `validate_against(catalog) == []` asserted in tests and
  exercised end-to-end in the live window.
- Anatomy is categorical with reserved sliders only where specified —
  structural: a numeric option group is a load-time format error unless its
  field is in the §12 closed list (height/weight/muscle, plus the age
  bounds); regioned (anatomy) numeric groups doubly rejected. Option files
  apply atomically, so a malformed fragment cannot half-merge a slider into
  an anatomy region.
- Adding a new option data-file surfaces new choices without code change —
  the form renders entirely from `creator_catalog()` (sections, quick
  membership, regions, widgets all data-driven); drop-ins surface at startup
  and live via "Reload options"; stale UI state prunes on reload.
- All free text passes through Layer 1 — live `check_text` feedback while
  typing (UX) plus the record-level gate on save (the boundary); selection/
  tag values are gated in strict prompt context (discrete prompt-bound
  tokens); slider keys gated (closing a Stage-1 gap).

**Creator (`app/ui/creator.py` + `web/creator.js`):** `describe()`/`reload()`
serialize the catalog for the UI; `create_character(payload)` does strict
shape validation (unknown groups/options rejected, sliders clamped and
finite, free text limited to the fixed field set) and returns structured
errors (`invalid`/`blocked`/`age`) the UI maps onto fields. §15 format gained
`section`, `quick`, and option `color` (all optional, backward compatible).

**Stage 3a DoD — MET (done-here; 452 tests passing; live-window scripted
smoke ALL PASS):**
- Checkpoint pick made and recorded — Illustrious-XL-family SDXL checkpoint
  (`docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §1), style-class-committed and file-swappable via
  `models.image.checkpoint_path` (§4); heavy variant + optional local
  pipeline-config dir wired.
- Record → structured prompt assembly (`app/imagegen/prompt.py`) is fully
  data-driven: quality preamble → subject anchor (code-derived from
  `gender_presentation`) → structural adult anchor + age-range fragment →
  option `prompt` fragments + slider `prompt_ranges` in catalog order →
  filtered `appearance_notes`. Groups gain a `render` flag; personality/voice
  and gender_presentation are `render:false` (chat-side / code-anchored). A
  drop-in option file changes rendering with no code change (§15), verified
  end-to-end via the live catalog.
- Image-prompt **Layer 1** attached: every fragment gated in strict `prompt`
  context with provenance (a blocked drop-in fragment names its group), plus
  an edge-normalized adjacency gate + zero-separator option-pair gate closing
  the cross-fragment join surface (a red-team HIGH: one-char separator
  overflow). **Layer 2** negative prompts carry age-coded steer-away anchors
  (`app/imagegen/data/`), positive prompt asserts adulthood structurally.
- Model call behind the swap scaffold (`app/imagegen/engine.py`): one heavy
  model at a time (§3), refuses while chat holds the slot, heavy-variant
  toggle honored, seeds resolved+recorded, all heavy imports lazy so the
  build sandbox imports clean and returns structured engine-unavailable
  errors. Generation + reproducibility sidecar persist under
  `characters/<id>/reference/` (the §6 bootstrap candidate location; no record
  mutation). Every generation + refusal audited (Layer 4).

**Adversarial verification (3-agent workflow):** red-team (prompt-gate
bypass + crash + path/ID + bridge-contract), correctness code review, and a
DoD audit. Execution-confirmed and all fixed: **HIGH** separator-overflow
join bypass (padding a fragment edge pushed a cross-fragment blocked term
past the join gate — now an edge-normalized + zero-sep-pair gate); **HIGH**
settings-persist `OSError` inside `load()`/`unload()` escaping the bridge
(now the backend is assigned before the persist and slot-writes are guarded);
**MEDIUM** `Infinity`/`1e999` in `image_gen` settings crashing the bridge via
`int(inf)` `OverflowError` (now finiteness-guarded); **MEDIUM** idempotent
`load()` + settings-derived sidecar checkpoint could record the wrong model
after a variant flip (now `load()` swaps on change and the sidecar records
the *actually-loaded* checkpoint); **MEDIUM** `_load_record` mapping
content/age/corrupt-file loads to `not_found` with no audit (now
`blocked`/`age`/`io` with a Layer-4 trail); R7 minor-coded school-scene terms
added to the contextual blocklist; L1 blank heavy-path fallback; L3 stale
VRAM slot reset at startup; M3 pipeline `close()` gc-then-empty-cache +
best-effort teardown; H2 offline posture (local `pipeline_config_dir` +
`local_files_only`, telemetry/progress-bar disabled before heavy import).

**Stage 3b DoD — MET (done-here; 516 tests passing, 1 skipped; live-window
scripted smoke ALL PASS):**
- Reference → steered generation, end-to-end: `set_reference` promotes a
  chosen in-character frame to `IdentityAnchor.reference_image_path` (stored
  char-relative — the ONLY record mutation the image pipeline makes);
  `generate_identity` re-assembles + re-gates the same 3a prompt and renders
  it IP-Adapter-steered by the stored reference, into `characters/<id>/
  identity/` with an `ip_adapter` provenance sidecar block. `clear_reference`
  + `reference_status` round out the surface.
- Checkpoint pick for the deferred IP-Adapter item (`docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`
  §7): local **h94/IP-Adapter** mirror, ViT-H, `standard`|`plus` variant
  selector. The weight ↔ image-encoder pairing (the one load-bearing footgun)
  is a code constant behind the selector, so a hand-edit cannot unpair them;
  `image_encoder_folder` pinned to the slash-form `models/image_encoder`.
- IP-Adapter call behind the swap scaffold: a SEPARATE identity backend built
  and torn down through the hardened swap branch (no in-place
  `load_ip_adapter`/scale-0 toggling — that stateful path is hardware-only
  and a no-image call raises). Load-key widened to `(checkpoint, ip_config)`
  with identity preconditions checked BEFORE the idempotency short-circuit;
  one heavy model at a time (§3); heavy-checkpoint variant still honored.
- Safety unchanged and re-run on every steered frame: Layer-1 prompt gate +
  Layer-2 negative age anchors + structural adult anchor. The reference is
  **path**-validated, not content-gated (the Layer-2 pixel classifier is 3c);
  `_resolve_reference` dual-containment-checks the stored path at set-time and
  again at use-time (it lives in hand-editable `character.json`). Layer-4
  audits `identity_generated` / `identity_reference_set|cleared` / refusals.
- `ip_adapter_scale` default 0.55, engine-bound `[0,1]`, per-call override;
  a bad hand-edit degrades to the default, never crashes. Fully-offline
  posture extended (local_files_only + config-gated `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`/
  `TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE`). Zero new dependency pins; imports clean without torch.

**Adversarial verification (design + review workflows).** A research+design
workflow first nailed the diffusers IP-Adapter SDXL API (the `load_ip_adapter`
sequence, the ViT-H `image_encoder_folder` slash-form footgun, that
`ip_adapter_image` is required once loaded so scale-0 is not a substitute for
unload) and synthesized the spec two independent designs were graded into.
Implementation caught its own bug via tests (identity-mode `ip_config=None`
was indistinguishable from base-mode `None` in the load-key, so an
unconfigured identity request could be served by a resident base backend —
fixed by checking identity preconditions before the idempotency short-circuit).
A 16-agent review workflow (red-team + code-review + DoD, each finding
adversarially verified) then surfaced exactly one confirmed defect that
survived verification: **MEDIUM** — a NUL byte in a stored reference path made
`Path.resolve()` raise `ValueError` (not `OSError`), escaping the resolver's
guard and breaking the bridge on the ordinary preview path; fixed with an
explicit up-front NUL reject plus broadening the guard to `(OSError, ValueError)`
(matching the sibling `_load_record`/`char_dir` boundaries). Confirmed
non-escape (stat faults before any out-of-dir open) and regression-tested
across all four callers. Everything else refuted or accepted-by-design (the
[HARDWARE] TOCTOU, the additive base-sidecar `stage` key).

**Stage 3c DoD — MET (done-here; 577 tests passing, 1 skipped; live-window
scripted smoke ALL PASS):**
- Seed batch from the single reference: `bootstrap_generate` reuses 3b
  `generate_identity` unchanged, varying ONLY the seed (fixed identity prompt/
  reference/scale — §6 needs a tight cluster, not pose variety), persisting
  append-only candidates under `bootstrap/candidates/`.
- Auto-filter behind four **fakeable** abstractions (`app/imagegen/cull.py`:
  `FaceEmbedder`/`QualityScorer`/`ContentClassifier`/`FaceSwapper`, path-in/
  dataclass-out) so the whole pure cull is sandbox-verified with fakes; only the
  real InsightFace/imgutils/inswapper backends are [HARDWARE]. Cull order:
  decode → detect → **content (Layer-2, hard, fail-closed)** → quality floor →
  identity similarity (ArcFace cosine ≥ 0.50) → aesthetic rank; survivors ranked
  and the top `grid_size` proposed.
- **Layer-2 image content classifier attaches here** (§11): hard-reject +
  delete + `filter_block`(layer 2) audit on every candidate, BEFORE quality/
  similarity, fail-closed (missing model → `CullUnavailable` at preflight so
  nothing is produced unclassified; a classify exception is a block), and
  re-run on the FINAL pixels in `confirm_vetted`. `minor_coded_tags.txt` is the
  editable tuning surface. Honest bar documented (defense-in-depth, not a
  guarantee).
- Optional face-swap (`inswapper`, default OFF) runs STRICTLY after the
  similarity cull on survivors only, re-classified + re-similarity-checked
  fail-closed with fallback to the original.
- Confirmation flow: `bootstrap_status` (grid/counts/phase), `confirm_vetted`
  (promote a subset → `vetted/` = the 3d input), `bootstrap_recull` (re-cull
  persisted candidates, NO image model), `clear_bootstrap`. `confirm_vetted`
  validates the selection against the TRUSTED manifest (membership + status),
  takes pixel paths from the manifest (not caller input), re-resolves
  containment, and re-classifies — no forged id / escaped path / blocked frame
  can enter the training set.
- §3 VRAM: `bootstrap_generate` unloads the image model in a `finally` (always
  frees the slot) and builds the CPU cull toolkit only afterward. §2 offline:
  models user-placed, `local_files_only`/`HF_HUB_OFFLINE`, no network. Zero
  record mutation (the vetted-manifest existence is the source of truth; no
  `has_lora`/`lora_path`/tier flag — that is 3d). New `BootstrapManifest`/
  `VettedManifest` on disk; all paths char-relative. Requirements 3c slice
  (`insightface`/`onnxruntime`/`dghs-imgutils`/`opencv-contrib-python`, dropping
  `opencv-python`); non-commercial license note.

**Adversarial verification (design + review workflows).** A research+design
workflow first nailed the InsightFace API for the unexecutable backends
(`FaceAnalysis(buffalo_l)` + `normed_embedding` cosine, the `<root>/models/
buffalo_l/` root footgun, `inswapper.get(img, target, source)` arg order,
offline loading, the research/non-commercial license) and graded two designs
into one spec. A 20-agent review workflow (red-team + code-review + DoD, each
finding adversarially verified) then confirmed the safety-critical properties
INTACT (no content-gate bypass, no un-vetted smuggling, VRAM sequencing correct,
fail-closed works) and surfaced 6 confirmed defects, all fixed: **A1** a
hand-edited manifest `candidate_id` could escape `characters/<id>/` at the
face-swap write (now `ensure_safe_id` at manifest load + a basename guard);
**A2** bridge methods could raise instead of returning structured errors — a
non-`CullUnavailable` toolkit-build failure (missing insightface import,
undecodable reference) and a corrupt/hand-edited manifest (JSON/`InvalidId`/
`TypeError`) — now `cull_unavailable`/`bootstrap_corrupt`; **A3** the `batch`
knob bypassed its `[1,256]` clamp on the default path (now clamped in the
coercion, the one knob without downstream re-validation); **A4** `confirm_vetted`
deleted the prior vetted set before copying (now a staged temp-then-`os.replace`
so a mid-copy `OSError` preserves it); **A5** the face-swap service path and
corrupt-manifest handling were untested (now covered). Regression-tested; the
[HARDWARE] backends, VRAM sequencing, and the content-gate flow were verified
correct and left unchanged.

**Stage 3d DoD — MET (done-here; 607 tests passing, 1 skipped; live-window
scripted smoke ALL PASS):**
- Trains a per-character identity LoRA on the confirmed vetted set (3c
  `VettedManifest`): each vetted image is containment-resolved (and must live
  under `vetted/`), captioned with a stable trigger + the record's *gated*
  identity description (dropping the booru composition anchors), laid out as a
  kohya dataset (`build_dataset`), trained, and the produced `.safetensors`
  collected (tolerating a suffixed output filename).
- Trainer behind a **fakeable** `LoraTrainer` (`app/imagegen/lora.py`), injected
  like the engine/cull factories, so the whole promotion flow is sandbox-
  verified with a fake trainer; the real backend is **kohya `sd-scripts` as a
  headless subprocess** (`CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, §2), user-placed + swappable. No
  heavy imports at module top; `import app.imagegen.lora` is clean without torch.
- Stores `lora/identity.safetensors` + a `LoraManifest` provenance sidecar and
  **flips `IdentityAnchor.has_lora` + `lora_path`** (the first record mutation
  since 3b's reference) + footprint. `lora_status` reports `has_lora` only when
  the flag AND the file are present; `clear_lora` fully un-promotes.
- §3 VRAM: the in-process image engine is **unloaded before** the trainer
  subprocess runs (so it gets the whole GPU), the slot is marked busy for the
  duration and reset in a `finally`, and a **failed re-train never destroys the
  prior LoRA** (the new file is `os.replace`d and the record flipped only on
  success). §2 offline: user-placed sd-scripts, no bundled weights, no new pip
  pins; every bridge method returns structured errors on the sandbox.
- **Deferred identity-tier-marker question RESOLVED:** `has_lora` + the
  vetted-manifest existence are the authoritative promotion state — **no**
  separate record tier field is added; quick vs detailed stays audited-not-
  persisted (see `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §12).

**Adversarial verification (3 review subagents — ultracode off, so individual
agents, not a workflow).** Red-team + correctness code-review + DoD audit, each
running executed repros. They confirmed the clean bills (VRAM sequencing, prior-
LoRA safety, promotion consistency, fail-closed error taxonomy, no scope creep)
and surfaced findings, all fixed: **HIGH** a valid-JSON manifest missing a
required key raised `KeyError` (a `LookupError`) straight through the bridge —
the `_load_*_manifest` guards omitted it (now caught, across the lora, vetted,
AND 3c bootstrap loaders); **MEDIUM** `save_lora_manifest`'s `OSError` was
unwrapped and could escape after promotion (now the provenance manifest is
written first, guarded → `io`, which also fixes a footprint under-count); **LOW**
the LoRA trigger derived from the path-safe-but-not-content-gated id (now a hash
→ provably `[a-z0-9]`); **LOW** a tampered vetted entry could feed an in-dir
non-image (e.g. `character.json`) into training (now vetted entries must live
under `vetted/`); **[HARDWARE]** the kohya config used `xformers` (→ `sdpa`, no
extra dep) and exact-name output collection (→ newest-`.safetensors` fallback).
Regression-tested; the [HARDWARE] subprocess backend was verified structurally
and left otherwise unchanged.

**Stage 3e DoD — MET (done-here; 644 tests passing, 1 skipped; live-window
scripted smoke ALL PASS):**
- Renders the core matrix (expressions × poses × the character's wardrobe, or
  an as-is dimension when none) LoRA-steered, bounded by `max_frames`. Each
  cell's prompt = the constant *gated* identity (assembler with the wardrobe
  group excluded) + the LoRA trigger (lead) + the cell's outfit/expression/pose
  (extra); a blocked cell is skipped + audited. Expressions/poses are editable
  data (`data/catalog_states.json`).
- **Engine gains LoRA-at-generation** (the 3d payoff): a catalog mode with the
  load-key widened to `(checkpoint, ip_config, lora)` and a
  `_DiffusersLoraSDXLBackend` (checkpoint + `load_lora_weights` unfused,
  per-generate `cross_attention_kwargs` scale). Base (3a) and identity (3b)
  paths are byte-unchanged; a different LoRA rides the hardened swap branch.
- **Auto-filter = the same 3c cull** ("same filter as training", §7):
  content-classify (Layer-2, hard, fail-closed, audited) → similarity to the
  reference → quality. A rejected frame is deleted and its cell regenerated up
  to `max_attempts`; only survivors enter the manifest. (The face-area floor is
  relaxed *for the catalog only* — pose-varied frames have small faces — while
  the safety content gate + similarity stay at the 3c values.)
- Fills the **Stage-1 `CatalogManifest`/`CatalogEntry`** under `catalog/`
  (`frame_id`, char-relative `path`, `state={expression,pose,outfit}`,
  `on_demand=False`, `bytes`). §3 VRAM: each pass generates with the LoRA image
  model, **unloads it**, then culls on the CPU toolkit; the new frames are
  staged and swapped over the prior catalog **only on success** (rollback-safe,
  so a failed re-generate preserves the prior catalog + manifest). **Zero
  record mutation** — 3e only reads `has_lora`/`lora_path`/`reference`.

**Adversarial verification (3 review subagents — red-team, code-review, DoD).**
They confirmed the clean bills (the widened load-key + mode preconditions, base/
identity paths unchanged, VRAM sequencing, the literal-3c-cull reuse, no 3f/3g
scope creep, zero record mutation) and — notably — that the unfused
`cross_attention_kwargs` scale IS honoured on the diffusers ≥0.31 PEFT backend
for both UNet and text encoders (no `set_adapters` change needed). Findings, all
fixed: **MEDIUM** `_finalize_catalog`'s swap wasn't rollback-safe — a mid-swap
`OSError` could leave `catalog.json` disagreeing with the frames on disk (now a
rename-aside + restore-on-failure, so any failure preserves a consistent prior
catalog); **LOW** `load_catalog_states` raised `AttributeError` on valid-but-non-
object JSON (`[]`/`null`) escaping the bridge (now guarded); **LOW/tuning** the
identity-tight cull systematically rejected pose-varied catalog frames (relaxed
`face_area_min` for the catalog, content gate unchanged). Regression-tested
(no_states, malformed states, partial-success `incomplete>0`, finalize rollback,
relaxed-area). The [HARDWARE] LoRA backend was verified structurally correct.

**Stage 3f DoD — MET (done-here; 680 tests passing, 1 skipped; live-window
scripted smoke ALL PASS):**
- **Resolves the deferred matting/keying approach:** a direct-ONNX
  reimplementation of rembg's ISNet pipeline (~30 lines, MIT, attributed) on
  the already-installed `onnxruntime`+`pillow` slice, with a **user-placed**
  `isnet-anime.onnx` (SkyTNT/anime-segmentation, Apache-2.0 provenance,
  ~176 MB) as the default; `isnet_general` and `birefnet` are constants-only
  config variants sharing one codepath. **No new pip deps, no runtime
  downloads.** rembg itself NOT installed (the old opencv-conflict rationale
  is stale — dropped upstream ~2.0.72; live objections: unconditional
  pymatting/scikit-image/scipy deps, a pooch runtime downloader,
  numpy/pillow/onnxruntime floor pins); transparent-background rejected
  (second cv2 distribution); keyable-background *generation* rejected
  (discards the 3e vetting, re-rolls identity, SDXL renders no trustworthy
  flat key).
- New `app/imagegen/matte.py` behind a **fakeable `Matter` Protocol** +
  injected `MatteFactory` (the cull.py idiom): `preflight_matte` (model +
  Layer-2 classifier — deliberately NOT the face models),
  `coerce_matte_config` (variant/erode/feather/coverage knobs,
  degrade-never-crash), the pure `evaluate_matte` coverage gate, and the
  `[HARDWARE]` `_OnnxMatter` with the research-verified per-variant rembg
  constants (reproduced quirks: divide-by-image-max, per-image min-max
  stretch; deviations: epsilon guard, **putalpha keyable output** — original
  RGB + straight soft alpha, never binarized; optional erode/feather halo
  knobs). Sandbox-clean imports (no numpy/PIL/onnxruntime at module level).
- `matte_catalog(id, force)`: per entry, containment + **direct-`.png`-child
  of `catalog/`** residency (stem-keyed outputs ⇒ .png-only makes collisions
  structurally impossible) → **Layer-2 re-screen fail-closed BEFORE the skip
  check** every run (blocked ⇒ purge pixels + sidecar + recorded matte +
  manifest entry, audited) → skip valid mattes unless `force` → `*.png.tmp`
  (a temp namespace no final can carry) → coverage gate → atomic promote →
  char-relative `matted_path`. Per-frame failures never abort; every result
  shape carries the tallies. **Optimistic `updated_at` token** aborts
  `catalog_changed` rather than clobber a concurrent 3e regen; a
  `character_id`-mismatched manifest is `catalog_corrupt` (`save_catalog`
  routes by the manifest's own id); an all-skipped run saves nothing. Mattes
  live INSIDE `catalog/` (die with 3e swaps, counted by `catalog_bytes`,
  removed by `clear_catalog`). **Zero record mutation; engine untouched**
  (CPU ONNX, zero VRAM, the confirm_vetted posture).
- 2 bridges (`image_matte_catalog`/`image_matte_status`); settings
  `models.image.matting_model_path` + `image_gen.matting.*`;
  `CatalogManifest` gains an optional backward-compatible `matting`
  provenance block; `store.matted_dir`; requirements 3f slice (no pins);
  `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §16–§17 (+ KNOWN LIMITS renumbered 16→18).

**Adversarial verification (research+design + review workflows — ultracode
on).** A research workflow first locked the rembg ISNet/BiRefNet pre/post
constants verbatim from source (incl. the divide-by-image-max and
unguarded-min-max-stretch hazards, the sigmoid-in-code split for BiRefNet,
licenses/md5s/URLs, and the CORRECTION that rembg's opencv dep is gone — the
exclusion rationale was updated, not parroted), and a judge merged two
independent designs into one spec (itself catching a nonexistent
`manifest.touch()`, a gate-after-skip contradiction, and the cross-character
`save_catalog` routing hazard). A 16-agent review workflow (red-team +
code-review + DoD; every finding independently re-executed by a skeptic — 12
confirmed, 0 refuted, 1 accepted-by-design) returned 31 clean bills
(containment incl. a 47-probe hand-edit sweep with zero tracebacks,
gate-before-skip, rollback/no-op/concurrency semantics, sandbox cleanliness,
VARIANTS re-verified against upstream) and findings, all fixed: **HIGH** a
hand-edited `"bytes": Infinity` in catalog.json raised `OverflowError`
through both new bridges — `int(inf)` is not a `ValueError`, the documented
`_generation_settings` hazard on the manifest channel (now caught across ALL
seven service loader guards, incl. the 3e catalog/record loaders, per the 3d
fix-across-loaders precedent); **MEDIUM** the blocked-frame purge deleted
only the canonical matte name while the skip check trusts ANY `matted_path`
into `matted/` — a hand-renamed matte of just-blocked pixels survived (the
purge now covers the recorded path under the same trust rule); **LOW**×2
(same root) hand-placed same-stem/other-extension sources collided onto one
matte file and the `*.tmp.png` sweep could eat a promoted final whose source
stem ended in `.tmp` (sources now `.png`-only; temp namespace now
`*.png.tmp`); **LOW** the all-failed escalation + abort dicts dropped the run
tallies and aborts left no run-level audit (tallies on every shape; aborts
log `catalog_matted` with `aborted=<kind>`); **LOW** a non-finite coverage
reading shipped an invalid-JSON `NaN` to the JS bridge, which would hang the
promise (finite-or-None now); **LOW** the factory closer freed nothing — the
matter held the live session ref (`_OnnxMatter.close()` added); plus doc/test
gaps (best-effort-token caveat + top-level kind list documented;
degenerate-under-force, default-arg-bridge, and write-then-raise-tmp test
arms added). Accepted-by-design residual: the optimistic token's
check-to-save TOCTOU window (best-effort, not a lock — documented; no
concurrent writer exists in the single-window app). Regression-tested
(**680 passing**).

**Next action (when resumed):** **begin Stage 3g** — on-demand generation +
cache: novel states generate on demand, run the same auto-filter, matte via
the 3f `Matter`, and cache into the growing per-character library
(`cache/`, `on_demand=true`, §7). The whole 3a–3f hardware track is now
validated on the target machine (RTX 4070 Super 12 GB) with a live
end-to-end character on disk (`c517663a…`: reference → 20-frame vetted set
→ trained LoRA → 20-frame matted catalog) to build 3g against.
**Residual hardware items (named in the pending flags, none gating 3g):**
3c Layer-2 false-negative recall check + optional face-swap leg
(user-directed); 3f edge-quality tuning over composite backgrounds (lands
with Stage-5 compositing) + the blocked-frame purge drill (pairs with the
recall check).

## DEFERRED SPEC ITEMS / OPEN QUESTIONS

Carried forward; resolve at the relevant stage:

- **Specific model picks** — image base checkpoint (Stage 3) and chat LLM (Stage 6), chosen against then-current options; both swappable.
- **Decay-model knobs + defaults** — finalized during Stage 6c tuning.
- **Permitted-vs-prohibited content line** — drafted in Stage 0 for user approval; governs Stages 3, 5, 6.
- **Matting/keying approach** — **RESOLVED at Stage 3f (2026-07-12):** direct-ONNX reimplementation of rembg's ISNet pipeline on the existing onnxruntime stack, user-placed `isnet-anime.onnx` default with `isnet_general`/`birefnet` config variants; rembg/transparent-background not installed (dependency conflicts + runtime downloaders); keyable-background generation rejected (discards 3e vetting, re-rolls identity). (`docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §16.)
- **Exact disk thresholds + LRU caps** — set at Stage 4.
- **Editor UI for option data-files** — later layer on the Stage-1 format; not scheduled, added when wanted.
- **Catalog manifest ↔ frames startup reconciliation** — the 3e catalog swap renames the frames dir and writes the sibling `catalog.json` in two non-atomic steps; a hard process-kill in that microsecond window can leave a `catalog.old/` orphan or a manifest that momentarily disagrees with disk. In-process failures are fully rolled back; only a kill is unhandled, and it self-heals on the next successful `generate_catalog`. A startup reconciliation pass (drop `*.old` orphans, verify manifest frames exist) is a **Stage 4 (Library & Management)** concern — added there, not 3e. *(2026-07-12 addendum: the same pass should sweep `bootstrap/candidates/` files absent from `bootstrap.json` — 3c persists each candidate as generated and saves the manifest at the end of the batch, so a mid-batch kill leaves orphan frame+sidecar pairs; harmless but footprint-counted.)*
- **Identity-tier marker on the record** — **RESOLVED at Stage 3d (2026-07-11):** no separate record-level tier field. `IdentityAnchor.has_lora` + `lora_path` (plus the vetted-manifest existence) are the authoritative promotion state; quick vs detailed creation stays audited (Layer 4), not persisted. (`docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §12.)

## CHANGE LOG

- *(init)* Documents created. All decisions Q1–Q13 codified in `DECISIONS.md`. Build plan drafted. No stages started.
- *(Stage 0 build)* Scaffolded the app: `app/` package (Python 3.11 `.venv`), single-window pywebview shell + JS↔Python bridge + web UI, `CharacterForge.pyw` launcher (relaunches into `.venv` under `pythonw`, `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, MessageBox on fatal error), JSON settings with atomic/thread-safe writes and the model-swap toggle scaffold, Layer-4 append-only JSONL audit log, and the Layer-1 deterministic content filter (`app/safety/`: obfuscation-resistant `normalize.py` + `layer1.py` matching engine + editable `data/*.txt` blocklists across 8 prohibited categories). Delivered `docs/CONTENT_POLICY.md` (draft, rulings R1–R8, awaiting sign-off). Isolation test suite added.
- *(Stage 0 verification)* Ran a multi-agent adversarial workflow (red-team bypass/false-positive lenses + backend/UI code review + DoD audit). It surfaced execution-confirmed Layer-1 bypasses (incomplete homoglyph table, no hyphen/concatenation/plural tolerance, doubled-letter and leet+separator gaps, missing written/copula/ordinal age forms), false positives (compound adult ages like "twenty-two years old", "lol i"→loli, "shot a"→shota, "mounted her horse", innocent proximity anchors), and backend/UI defects (audit `json.dumps` outside try, settings temp-file race, set_setting persistence-failure contract, audit re-enable ordering, external-link/one-window hardening, unsafe geometry parse). All fixed: rewrote the matching engine (complete homoglyph table + name-based Latin-letter fold, joiner/punct/spread families with ASCII edge guards, doubled-letter + post-leet folding, automatic plural tolerance), extended age regexes, retuned data files, and patched the backend/UI. A second adversarial round found only the residual small-capital-block and multiword-plural classes, both then closed structurally. Test suite: **236 passing**; live window smoke re-confirmed (1 window).
- *(Stage 0 sign-off — 2026-07-10)* User approved `docs/CONTENT_POLICY.md` v1 (R1–R8 as drafted, no amendments). Content line frozen into `DECISIONS.md` §11. **Stage 0 marked DONE.** Per user request, paused before starting Stage 1.
- *(Stage 1 build — 2026-07-10)* Built the `app/model/` package: `Age` value type (structural 20+ gate, §11 Layer 3), `CharacterRecord` (structured tags + filtered free-text + region-grouped categorical anatomy + reserved height/weight/muscle sliders + `IdentityAnchor` has-LoRA/reference/LoRA/footprint + `CatalogManifest`), the §15 option-definition data-file format + merging loader, and a persistence layer. Added 7 bundled option files (25 groups) and an isolation test suite.
- *(Stage 1 verification — 2026-07-10)* Ran a multi-agent adversarial workflow (attack lenses on the age gate, content gates, option loader, and persistence + code review + DoD audit). It surfaced execution-confirmed defects: post-construction age mutation and free-text-KEY / selection-value / tag-value channels bypassing the gates and persisting to disk; **path traversal via a crafted `record.id`** (save/delete/catalog escaping the store, incl. `rmtree` of external dirs); and option-loader fragility (UTF-8 BOM rejection, no per-file isolation so one bad drop-in bricked the creator, uncoerced numeric bounds crashing at use time, alias/tag string-explosion). All fixed: `__setattr__`-enforced age + safe-id invariants, a single normalization/gate choke point covering every key and value on every channel, `ensure_safe_id` confining all store paths, and a BOM-tolerant, per-file-isolated, type-coercing loader with an `errors` list. A re-run confirmed all 30 attack reproductions now blocked. **321 tests passing.** **Stage 1 marked DONE.**
- *(Stage 2 build — 2026-07-10)* Built the creator: `app/ui/creator.py` (`CreatorService` — catalog description for the UI, live `reload()`, strict payload validation → record → store, structured `invalid`/`blocked`/`age` errors, Layer-4 audit of creations and blocks), bridge methods on the shell `Api` (`creator_catalog`/`creator_reload_options`/`create_character`), and a fully data-driven front-end (`web/creator.js`): quick + detailed paths, section cards, anatomy as collapsible body-region groups (§12 progressive disclosure), chips/swatch-chips/dropdown/slider widgets, live Layer-1 feedback on name + free text, field-level error highlighting. §15 format extended (backward-compatible): group `section` + `quick`, option `color`; bundled files annotated. Structural §12 rule added to the loader: numeric groups are a closed list (height/weight/muscle + age bounds) and can never carry a region.
- *(Stage 3a build — 2026-07-10)* Built the image pipeline base-generation slice: new `app/imagegen/` package — `prompt.py` (record → gated structured positive/negative prompt, data-driven from option `prompt` fragments + slider `prompt_ranges` + filtered `appearance_notes`, code-derived subject anchor, structural adult anchor, image-side Layer 1 with provenance + cross-fragment adjacency gate, Layer 2 negative-prompt anchors), `engine.py` (SDXL-derived diffusers call behind the §3 swap scaffold — lazy heavy imports, CUDA-only real backend, VRAM-slot sequencing against `models.active`, checkpoint/variant/config resolution, seed handling, request validation), `service.py` (bridge-facing orchestration: load→gate→generate→persist frame + reproducibility sidecar under `characters/<id>/reference/`→audit; structured `{ok:...}` results), and editable `data/*.txt` prompt files. Recorded the deferred checkpoint pick (Illustrious-XL-family SDXL) with rationale in new `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`. Extended the §15 option format with a backward-compatible `render` flag (default true; personality/voice + gender_presentation set false); added `image_gen` settings + `models.image.pipeline_config_dir`; wired `ImageService` through `main.build_services` and five `image_*` bridge methods on the shell `Api`; uncommented the Stage-3a slice of `requirements-full.txt` (install on target only). Startup now resets a stale persisted VRAM slot.
- *(Stage 3a verification — 2026-07-10)* Ran a three-agent adversarial workflow (red-team on the prompt gate / crashes / path-ID / bridge contract; correctness code review; DoD audit). Execution-confirmed and all fixed: **HIGH** separator-overflow join bypass (one trailing punctuation char pushed a cross-fragment blocked term past the join gate and reached real generation, logged as clean — closed with an edge-normalized adjacency gate + zero-separator option-pair gate; the residual 3-way-word-split is documented under the §11 honest bar); **HIGH** settings-persist `OSError` inside `load()`/`unload()` escaping every image bridge method raw (backend now assigned before the persist; slot writes guarded; teardown best-effort); **MEDIUM** `Infinity`/`1e999`/`-Infinity` in `image_gen` settings crashing the bridge via `int(inf)` `OverflowError` outside the try (now finiteness-guarded, never raises); **MEDIUM** idempotent `load()` + settings-time sidecar checkpoint recording the wrong model after a variant flip (load now swaps on change; sidecar records the actually-loaded checkpoint + size); **MEDIUM** `_load_record` collapsing content-blocked / underage / corrupt-file loads into `not_found` with no Layer-4 trail (now `blocked`+audit / `age` / `io`); **MEDIUM/LOW** R7 minor-coded school-scene backgrounds (classroom/chalkboard/blackboard/school desk/school hallway added to `minors_contextual.txt`); **LOW** blank heavy-checkpoint path not falling back; **LOW** stale persisted VRAM slot after a crash; plus M3 `close()` gc-then-empty-cache and the H2 offline/no-console posture (local `pipeline_config_dir` + `local_files_only`; `HF_HUB_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`/`_PROGRESS_BARS` and `diffusers` progress bar disabled before the heavy import, so a tqdm write under `pythonw` cannot fail the load). Clean bills: path/store confinement (all crafted ids → structured `not_found`/`invalid`, no escape from `reference/`), option `aliases`/`tags`/`label` do not leak into prompts, atomic O_EXCL frame-name reservation (no same-second overwrite; concurrency test), the age gate and negative-prompt exemption. **452 tests passing; scripted live-window smoke (create → engine status → prompt preview → structured engine-unavailable generate → slot release → cleanup) ALL PASS, one window throughout.** **Stage 3a marked DONE-HERE (hardware-validation flag pending).**
- *(Stage 3b build — 2026-07-11)* Built IP-Adapter baseline identity on the 3a pipeline. Ran a research+design workflow first to lock the diffusers IP-Adapter SDXL API before writing the unexecutable [HARDWARE] backend (confirmed the `load_ip_adapter(dir, subfolder, weight_name, image_encoder_folder, local_files_only)` → `set_ip_adapter_scale` → `pipe(..., ip_adapter_image=)` sequence; the ViT-H `image_encoder_folder="models/image_encoder"` slash-form footgun; that `ip_adapter_image` is required once loaded so `set_ip_adapter_scale(0)` is not a substitute for `unload_ip_adapter`), then graded two independent designs into one spec. `engine.py`: `GenerationRequest.ip_adapter_scale` (validated `[0,1]`, omit-if-None so base sidecars are unchanged); `IPAdapterConfig` + an `IP_ADAPTER_VARIANTS` code table (`standard`/`plus`, both ViT-H) so the weight↔encoder pairing is unhittable by hand-edit; a separate `_DiffusersIPAdapterSDXLBackend` that loads the adapter in `__init__` and is torn down whole on a mode switch (no in-place toggling); `load(mode)` with the load-key widened to `(checkpoint, ip_config)` and identity preconditions checked before the idempotency short-circuit; `generate_identity(request, reference)`; `status()` IP-Adapter availability block. `service.py`: `_resolve_reference` dual-containment resolver (set-time + use-time, since the stored path is hand-editable), `set_reference`/`clear_reference`/`reference_status`/`generate_identity`, `_persist` refactored to a parameterized `_persist_frame` writing steered frames + an `ip_adapter` sidecar block under `characters/<id>/identity/`, `_ip_adapter_scale` coercion, `preview_prompt.has_reference`. Settings gained `models.image.ip_adapter.{dir,variant}` + `image_gen.ip_adapter_scale`; four `image_*` bridge methods; `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §7–§8 (model layout, footgun, path-safety, output, 3b hardware checklist). Zero new dependency pins (the IP-Adapter weights + ViT-H encoder are user-placed, like the checkpoint). Implementation caught its own bug via a failing test — identity-mode `ip_config=None` (unconfigured) was indistinguishable from base-mode `None` in the load-key, so an unconfigured identity request could be silently served by a resident base backend; fixed by checking identity preconditions before the idempotency return.
- *(Stage 3b verification — 2026-07-11)* Ran a 16-agent review workflow (red-team + correctness code-review + DoD audit → each of the 12 raised findings adversarially verified by an independent skeptic → triage). Exactly one defect survived verification (raised independently by two dimensions): **MEDIUM** — a NUL byte in a stored `reference_image_path` makes `Path.resolve()` raise `ValueError` (not `OSError`), which escaped the resolver's `except OSError` guard and propagated raw out of every bridge caller, including the ordinary `preview_prompt`→`has_reference` path (a §2 one-window/no-console contract break). Fixed with an explicit up-front NUL reject plus broadening the guard to `(OSError, ValueError)` — matching the sibling `_load_record`/`char_dir` boundaries — and regression-tested across all four callers (set-time + the three use-time paths). Confirmed it is a robustness/bridge-contract break only, NOT a containment escape (`stat()` faults before any out-of-dir open; the dual-containment traversal/absolute/`..`/symlink defenses are intact). Everything else refuted or accepted-by-design: the [HARDWARE] load/generate reference TOCTOU (single-user offline, no adversary between check and use), the additive base-sidecar `stage` key, reference-is-path-validated-not-content-gated (the Layer-2 pixel classifier is 3c), and lazy heavy imports. Clean bills: the widened load-key + identity-precondition ordering, `to_dict` omit-if-None, `unload()` ip_config reset, the offline posture, and no scope creep (no 3c cull/FaceID, no 3e catalog, no 3g cache, no LoRA; the record's only new mutation is `reference_image_path`). **516 tests passing (1 skipped: symlink-escape test needs OS symlink privilege); scripted live-window smoke (create → reference status → no-reference generate → set-reference stored char-relative → has-reference → structured engine-unavailable steered generate → path-traversal rejected → clear → status) ALL PASS, one window throughout.** **Stage 3b marked DONE-HERE (hardware-validation flag pending).**
- *(Stage 3c build — 2026-07-11)* Built identity bootstrap + auto-filter on the 3b steer. Ran a research+design workflow first to lock the InsightFace/imgutils/inswapper APIs before writing the unexecutable [HARDWARE] backends (`FaceAnalysis(name="buffalo_l", root=<dir-containing-models/>, allowed_modules=["detection","recognition"])` → `app.get(bgr, max_num=0)` → `.normed_embedding` unit-cosine; `get_wd14_tags` ∩ `minor_coded_tags.txt`; `anime_dbaesthetic`; `inswapper.get(img, target, source, paste_back=True)`; offline via pre-placed files + `local_files_only`/`HF_HUB_OFFLINE`; the research/non-commercial license), then graded two designs into one spec. New `app/model/bootstrap.py` (`BootstrapCandidate`/`BootstrapManifest`/`VettedEntry`/`VettedManifest`, pure data, `ensure_safe_id`-confined ids); `store.py` bootstrap/vetted path helpers + save/load/clear. New `app/imagegen/cull.py` (sandbox-clean): `CullUnavailable`, the four `FaceEmbedder`/`QualityScorer`/`ContentClassifier`/`FaceSwapper` Protocols + dataclasses + `CullConfig`, the pure `score_candidate` (content-first, fail-closed) + `cull_and_rank`, `preflight_cull`, `coerce_cull_config`, and the lazy-import real backends behind a `ToolkitFactory` injected like the engine's backend factory. `service.py` gained `bootstrap_generate`/`bootstrap_recull`/`bootstrap_status`/`confirm_vetted`/`clear_bootstrap` with generate→unload-in-finally→CPU-cull VRAM sequencing, the Layer-2 gate wired hard+fail-closed+audited on candidates and confirm-time final pixels, and confirm-subset validation against the trusted manifest. Settings: `models.image.{face_recognition_dir,content_classifier_dir,face_swapper_path,onnx_providers}` + `image_gen.bootstrap.{...}`; 5 `image_*` bridges; `minor_coded_tags.txt`; requirements 3c slice (added `insightface`/`onnxruntime`/`dghs-imgutils`/`opencv-contrib-python`, dropped `opencv-python`; license note); `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §10–§11. Zero record mutation (§6). A failing test caught its own bug during build (kept-count vs floor); the aesthetic-tiebreak ranking was corrected.
- *(Stage 3c verification — 2026-07-11)* Ran a 20-agent review workflow (red-team + code-review + DoD, each of 16 findings adversarially verified → triage). The verifiers confirmed the safety-critical invariants INTACT — no content-gate bypass, no un-vetted/forged-id smuggling into the vetted set, VRAM sequencing correct (image model unloaded in `finally` before the CPU cull), offline posture correct, classifier fail-closed — and surfaced 6 confirmed defects, all fixed: **A1 (safety/path)** a hand-edited manifest `candidate_id` with `..` could escape `characters/<id>/` at the optional face-swap write (now `ensure_safe_id` at `BootstrapCandidate.from_dict` + a basename guard in `_apply_face_swap`; confirmed the escaped file still can't reach the vetted set — rejected by the confirm-time containment check); **A2 (MEDIUM, §2)** bridge methods could raise instead of returning `{ok:false,kind}` — a non-`CullUnavailable` toolkit-build failure (missing `insightface` import, undecodable reference) → now `cull_unavailable` at both call sites, and a corrupt/hand-edited manifest (`JSONDecodeError`/`InvalidId`/`TypeError`) → now `bootstrap_corrupt` via guarded load helpers, plus `OSError` guards on save/`rmtree`; **A3 (LOW)** `image_gen.bootstrap.batch` bypassed its `[1,256]` clamp on the `batch=None` path → now clamped in `coerce_cull_config` (the one knob with no downstream per-request re-validation; the verifiers confirmed the other per-image settings are correctly crash-guard-only like 3a/3b); **A4 (LOW)** `confirm_vetted` cleared the prior vetted set before the copy loop → now staged into `vetted.new/` and `os.replace`d only after the full build, so a mid-copy `OSError` preserves the prior set; **A5** the entire `_apply_face_swap` body and corrupt-manifest handling were untested → added service tests (swap re-classify/re-similarity + fallback, tampered/corrupt manifest, arbitrary factory exception, atomic-copy-failure). All CONFIRMED findings reproduced-then-fixed; severity corrections from the verifiers were honored (not over-escalated). Clean/left-alone by design: the [HARDWARE] backends (lazy imports; `import app.imagegen.cull` clean without torch/insightface/onnxruntime/cv2/imgutils), the content-gate flow, and scope (no 3d LoRA / 3e catalog / 3f matting / 3g cache; zero record mutation). **577 tests passing (1 skipped: symlink-escape needs OS privilege); scripted live-window smoke (status → no-reference generate → no-bootstrap recull/confirm → clear → set-reference → face-models-missing generate) ALL PASS, one window throughout, every path structured.** **Stage 3c marked DONE-HERE (hardware-validation flag pending).**
- *(Stage 3d build — 2026-07-11)* Built LoRA promotion: the confirmed vetted set (3c) → a per-character identity LoRA. New `app/model/lora.py` (`LoraManifest` provenance, char-relative, `ensure_safe_id`-confined) + store helpers (`lora_dir`/`lora_dataset_dir`/`lora_manifest_path`, `save/load_lora_manifest`, `clear_lora`). New `app/imagegen/lora.py` (sandbox-clean — no in-process heavy imports; the training weight is in the subprocess): `TrainConfig`/`coerce_train_config` (quality-max §16 defaults, finite+clamped), `TrainRequest`/`TrainItem`, the `LoraTrainer` Protocol + `TrainerFactory` (injected like the engine/cull factories), pure `build_dataset` (kohya `<repeats>_identity/` layout + captions), `preflight_train`, and the [HARDWARE] `_KohyaSubprocessTrainer` (builds `train_config.toml`, runs `sdxl_train_network.py` headless via `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`, collects the `.safetensors`). `service.py` gained `train_lora`/`lora_status`/`clear_lora`: resolve+containment-check each vetted image (must be under `vetted/`), build the trigger (`cfid`+hash) + the *gated* caption (from `_assemble`, dropping the booru composition anchors), prep the dataset, **unload the image engine so the trainer gets the GPU** (§3, slot reset in `finally`), train, `os.replace` the LoRA into place + write provenance + flip `has_lora`/`lora_path`/footprint — all only on success (a failed re-train preserves the prior LoRA). Settings: `models.image.lora_trainer_dir`/`lora_trainer_python` + `image_gen.lora_train.*`; 3 `image_*` bridges; requirements 3d slice (no new pip pins — user-placed sd-scripts); `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §12–§13. The deferred identity-tier-marker question was resolved (no record tier field). Zero engine generation changes (LoRA-at-generation is 3e). A test caught a config-clamp expectation bug during build (1e999→default vs a finite→clamp).
- *(Stage 3d verification — 2026-07-11)* Ran three individual review subagents (ultracode off → the Agent tool, not a workflow): red-team, correctness code-review, DoD/scope audit, each executing repros. They confirmed the clean bills — VRAM sequencing (engine unloaded before the trainer; `models.active` ends `None` on every path), prior-LoRA-survives-failed-retrain, promotion consistency (only `has_lora`/`lora_path`/footprint mutate), fail-closed error taxonomy, no scope creep (engine generate path unchanged; no 3e catalog/3f matting/3g cache) — and surfaced findings, all fixed: **HIGH** a valid-JSON manifest missing a required key raised `KeyError` (a `LookupError`, not in the guard tuples) straight through the bridge — fixed across the lora/vetted/**bootstrap** loaders (self-verified the `KeyError` escape first); **MEDIUM** `save_lora_manifest`'s `OSError` was unwrapped and could escape *after* the record was promoted — now the provenance manifest is written first (guarded → `io`), which also fixes the DoD-flagged footprint under-count (footprint now counts `lora.json`); **LOW** the trigger derived from the path-safe-but-not-content-gated id — now a SHA1 hash → provably `[a-z0-9]`, no minor-coded substring, no short-prefix collision; **LOW** a tampered vetted manifest could feed an in-dir non-image (`character.json`) into training — now a vetted entry must resolve under `vetted/`; **[HARDWARE]** the kohya TOML forced `xformers` (→ `sdpa`, no extra dep) and collected the output by exact name (→ newest-`.safetensors` fallback for sd-scripts step/epoch suffixes). Regression-tested (corrupt-missing-key manifests, `save_lora_manifest` OSError→io, hashed-trigger, footprint-includes-manifest, non-vetted-path skip). **607 tests passing (1 skipped: symlink-escape needs OS privilege); scripted live-window smoke (lora status → no-vetted train → clear → forge a vetted set → structured precondition refusal) ALL PASS, one window throughout, every path structured.** **Stage 3d marked DONE-HERE (hardware-validation flag pending).**
- *(Stage 3e build — 2026-07-11)* Built seed catalog generation. **Engine LoRA-at-generation** (the 3d payoff): `GenerationRequest.lora_scale`, a `_DiffusersLoraSDXLBackend` (checkpoint + `load_lora_weights` unfused + per-generate `cross_attention_kwargs` scale), the `_default_backend_factory` widened to 4-arg dispatch, `load(mode='catalog', lora=...)` with the load-key widened to `(checkpoint, ip_config, lora)` (catalog preconditions before the idempotency short-circuit), `generate_catalog`, and `loaded_lora`/`loaded_mode` status — base (3a) and identity (3b) paths byte-unchanged. New `app/imagegen/catalog.py` (pure, sandbox-clean): `CatalogConfig`/`coerce_catalog_config`, `load_catalog_states` (from editable `data/catalog_states.json`), `record_outfits` (wardrobe or as-is), `build_cells` (the capped matrix). Extended `PromptAssembler.assemble` with `exclude_groups`/`lead`/`extra` (all gated + deduped + adjacency-checked) so a catalog cell = constant gated identity minus wardrobe + the LoRA trigger + the cell's outfit/expression/pose. `service.py` gained `generate_catalog`/`catalog_status`/`clear_catalog` with the generate→unload→cull-per-pass VRAM sequence, the **same 3c cull** as the auto-filter (content fail-closed + similarity + quality; rejected cells regenerated up to `max_attempts`), a staged `catalog.new/` swap that preserves the prior catalog on failure, and the Stage-1 `CatalogManifest`/`CatalogEntry` filled under `catalog/`. Store gained `catalog_frames_dir`/`clear_catalog`; settings `image_gen.catalog.*`; 3 `image_*` bridges; `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §14–§15. Zero record mutation; no 3f/3g surface. A test caught its own arg-order bug during build.
- *(Stage 3e verification — 2026-07-11)* Ran three individual review subagents (red-team, code-review, DoD/scope). They confirmed the clean bills — the widened `(checkpoint, ip_config, lora)` load-key + catalog-preconditions-before-idempotency (an unconfigured catalog request can't be masked by a resident base backend), base/identity engine paths unchanged, VRAM sequencing (image model unloaded before the CPU cull each pass; `models.active` ends `None`), the auto-filter is the *literal* 3c `score_candidate`+`coerce_cull_config`, and no scope creep (`matted_path` stays None, `on_demand` False, zero record mutation) — and, resolving a cross-agent question, that the unfused `cross_attention_kwargs` scale IS honoured on the diffusers ≥0.31 PEFT backend for both UNet and text encoders (no `set_adapters` change needed; default scale 1.0 is safe regardless). Findings, all fixed: **MEDIUM** `_finalize_catalog`'s swap was not rollback-safe — a mid-swap `os.replace`/`save_catalog` `OSError` could leave `catalog.json` disagreeing with the frames on disk (phantom manifest); now the prior catalog is renamed aside and RESTORED on any failure, so every failure path leaves a consistent prior catalog; **LOW** `load_catalog_states` raised `AttributeError` on valid-but-non-object JSON (`[]`/`null`/`42`) escaping the `image_generate_catalog` bridge (self-verified, now `isinstance(dict)`-guarded); **LOW/tuning** the identity-tight cull (`face_area_min=0.04`) systematically rejected the deliberately pose-varied catalog (full-body/over-shoulder = small faces) → a catalog-only relaxed `face_area_min` (0.01) while the Layer-2 content gate + similarity floor stay at the 3c values. A late red-team re-run confirmed both fixes hold and surfaced one **LOW residual** — if the rollback's OWN restore `os.replace` also fails (a double disk-fault), the manifest could be left dangling; now the dangling manifest is dropped so `catalog_status` reports a consistent "no catalog" (the prior frames remain in `catalog.old/` for recovery, self-healing on the next run). Regression-tested (no_states, malformed states→empty, partial-success `incomplete>0`, finalize rollback preserves the prior catalog, the double-fault drops the dangling manifest, relaxed-area keeps small-face frames). Accepted residual (deferred, §below): a *hard process-kill* in the microsecond window between the two-step frame rename + the manifest write is not journaled/reconciled at startup — self-healing on the next successful run. **645 tests passing (1 skipped: symlink-escape needs OS privilege); scripted live-window smoke (catalog status → no-lora generate → clear → forge has_lora+reference → structured no-checkpoint refusal) ALL PASS, one window throughout, every path structured.** **Stage 3e marked DONE-HERE (hardware-validation flag pending).**
- *(Stage 3f build — 2026-07-12)* Built matting / keyable output. Ran a research+design workflow first (5 web researchers → 2 independent designs → a merging judge) to lock the unexecutable [HARDWARE] facts from source before coding: rembg's exact ISNet/BiRefNet pre/post constants (1024² LANCZOS, per-variant mean/std, divide-by-image-MAX not /255, first-output-channel-0, unguarded per-image min-max stretch, sigmoid-in-code only for BiRefNet, dynamic input-name reading), model provenance/licenses/md5s (isnet-anime = SkyTNT/anime-segmentation, Apache-2.0, ~176 MB, rembg v0.0.0 release asset), and the dependency picture — including the CORRECTION that rembg's opencv-python-headless dep is gone upstream (~2.0.72), so the deferred-item resolution cites the live objections (pymatting/scikit-image/scipy hard deps, pooch runtime downloader, numpy≥2.3/pillow≥12.1/ort≥1.23 floors) instead. **Method pick (deferred item RESOLVED):** direct-ONNX reimplementation on the already-installed onnxruntime+pillow slice, user-placed `isnet-anime.onnx` default, `isnet_general`/`birefnet` constants-only variants, putalpha keyable output (original RGB + straight soft alpha; rembg's naive_cutout black-fringes on re-composite), epsilon-guarded stretch, optional erode/feather halo knobs — no new pip pins, no downloads; keyable-background *generation* rejected (discards 3e vetting, re-rolls identity, no trustworthy SDXL flat key). New `app/imagegen/matte.py` (fakeable `Matter` Protocol + `MatteFactory` + `MatteToolkit` with the Layer-2 classifier, `preflight_matte`, `coerce_matte_config`, pure `evaluate_matte`, `[HARDWARE]` `_OnnxMatter`); `service.py` `matte_catalog`/`matte_status` + `_load_catalog_manifest` (with a cross-character `character_id`-mismatch guard — 3f is the first flow that round-trips catalog.json, and `save_catalog` routes by the manifest's own id) — per-frame: containment + direct-`.png`-child residency → Layer-2 re-screen fail-closed BEFORE the skip check (blocked ⇒ purge + de-manifest + audit) → skip/force → `*.png.tmp` → coverage gate → atomic promote → char-relative `matted_path`; optimistic `updated_at` token → `catalog_changed`; all-skipped = true no-op; mattes inside `catalog/` (die with 3e swaps, footprint-counted, cleared free). `CatalogManifest.matting` provenance (backward-compatible); `store.matted_dir`; 2 bridges; `models.image.matting_model_path` + `image_gen.matting.*`; requirements 3f slice; `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §16–§17 + KNOWN LIMITS renumber. Zero record mutation; engine untouched; no 3g surface.
- *(Stage 3f verification — 2026-07-12)* Ran a 16-agent review workflow (red-team + correctness code-review + DoD/spec audit → every raised finding independently re-executed by a skeptic: 12 CONFIRMED, 0 refuted, 1 accepted-by-design). 31 clean bills: containment + a 47-probe hand-edit sweep (settings × manifest × path oddities) with zero bridge tracebacks, gate-before-skip re-screen semantics, prior-artifact/rollback/no-op/concurrency behavior, VARIANTS re-verified verbatim against upstream rembg, sandbox cleanliness, zero record mutation. Findings, all fixed: **HIGH** hand-edited `"bytes": Infinity` in catalog.json raised `OverflowError` through both new bridges (`int(inf)` is not a `ValueError` — the codebase's own documented `_generation_settings` hazard, missed on the manifest channel; now caught across ALL seven service loader guards incl. the 3e catalog + record loaders, per the 3d fix-across-loaders precedent); **MEDIUM** the blocked-frame purge deleted only the canonical matte name while the skip check trusts ANY `matted_path` resolving into `matted/` — a hand-renamed matte of just-blocked pixels survived (purge now covers the recorded path under the same trust rule); **LOW** stem-keyed outputs let hand-placed same-stem/other-extension sources collide onto one matte (silent pixel swap / cross-entry purge) — sources now `.png`-only, collisions structurally impossible; **LOW** the `*.tmp.png` sweep could destroy a promoted final whose hand-placed source stem ended in `.tmp`, breaking failed-re-matte-keeps-prior (temp namespace now `*.png.tmp`, which no final can carry); **LOW** the all-failed escalation + `catalog_changed`/save-`io` aborts dropped the run tallies and left no run-level audit (tallies on every result shape; aborts log `catalog_matted` with `aborted=<kind>`); **LOW** a non-finite coverage reading shipped a bare `NaN` into the bridge payload — invalid strict JSON that would hang the JS promise on `JSON.parse` (finite-or-None guard); **LOW** the factory closer nulled a local while `_OnnxMatter` held the live session ref (a real `close()` now drops it); plus documented the best-effort concurrency caveat + full top-level kind list in §16 and added the degenerate-under-force / default-arg-bridge / write-then-raise-tmp test arms. Accepted-by-design: the optimistic token's check-to-save TOCTOU window (labeled best-effort in code + docs; no concurrent writer in a single-window app). **680 tests passing (1 skipped); scripted live-window smoke (create → no-catalog status/refusal → forged catalog → matting_model_missing → dummy files → structured matte_unavailable → escaped matted_path untrusted → clear) ALL PASS, one window throughout, every path structured.** **Stage 3f marked DONE-HERE (hardware-validation flag pending).**
- *(Hardware install + first validation — 2026-07-12)* Full `requirements-full` install on the target machine — **RTX 4070 Super, 12 GB VRAM** (note: the plan's VRAM assumptions were written against a 16 GB floor; SDXL fp16 generation fits, 3d LoRA training becomes the tightest fit and a first-class validation item). Installed: torch 2.13.0+cu126 (CUDA verified live) + torchvision 0.28, diffusers 0.39 / transformers 5.13 / accelerate 1.14, insightface 1.0.1 (prebuilt wheel — no compile; `FaceAnalysis`/`model_zoo` API surface verified compatible with the 3c code), onnxruntime 1.27, dghs-imgutils 0.19, opencv-contrib-python 4.11 + numpy 1.26.4 (a transitive `opencv-python` dep re-created the forbidden dual-cv2 state — caught and removed, contrib-only reinstalled; numpy<2 is imgutils' hard pin, torch runs on it). User-placed weights live in repo-local `models/` (now gitignored): `isnet-anime.onnx` (md5-verified), the buffalo_l pack, and the imgutils classifier cache prewarmed into `models/classifier_cache`. **Wiring fix found at validation:** `content_classifier_dir` was a preflight witness only — imgutils resolves the HF cache via `HF_HOME`, which freezes at the first hub import (the engine's, in the normal flow), so the configured dir was never actually consulted; added `cull.pin_hf_cache()` called at app startup (+ factory `setdefault` backstops + unit test; **681 tests passing**). **3f hardware validation (§17): items 1–3 and 8–9 PASS** — the transcribed-constants parity diff vs real rembg on two real anime frames came back **bit-identical (max alpha diff 0)**; a real end-to-end `matte_catalog` (real ISNet + WD14 Layer-2, `HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1`) matted 2/2 frames with provenance + an idempotent second-run skip at ~1.2 s/frame CPU; buffalo_l detects the anime test face at det=0.583 (just above the 0.5 floor — recorded as a 3c calibration signal). Remaining §17 items (edge-quality tuning over composite backgrounds, the purge drill, lifecycle) queue behind the first real 3a–3e catalog. **Checkpoint placed the same day:** `models/waiIllustriousSDXL_v150.safetensors` (WAI-Illustrious SDXL v15.0, 6,938,040,682 bytes, SHA256 `befc694a296f75e996488ebf9f9db8a1493bd059b6e704b975829e87d5aeb4fa`) wired to `checkpoint_path`. **First real 3a render PASS** (scripted, real services): gated prompt → coherent on-record frame (silver-haired elf, adult anchors held) at seed 12345; first render 22.1 s incl. load + one-time config warm, **steady-state 9.7 s/frame** at 832×1216/28 steps, **VRAM peak 10.35 / 12.0 GB** (base generation fits the 12 GB card with ~1.6 GB headroom), slot released clean. Observed: the assembled prompt ran 115 tokens vs CLIP's 77 — the documented §18 truncation limit (safety anchors lead the prompt by design, so the tail-loss is style fragments); flagged for prompt-budget awareness at 3e where cell fragments append.
- *(Stage 3b hardware validation — 2026-07-12)* Ran the full §8 checklist on the target machine (RTX 4070 Super 12 GB), scripted real-services runs. **Mirror fetched + wired:** local h94/IP-Adapter under `models/ip_adapter/` — `ip-adapter_sdxl_vit-h.safetensors` (698,391,064 B), `ip-adapter-plus_sdxl_vit-h.safetensors` (847,517,512 B), ViT-H `models/image_encoder/` (`model.safetensors` 2,528,373,448 B + config; hidden 1280 → projection 1024 confirmed ViT-H); **all three SHA256s bit-match the HF LFS metadata**; `ip_adapter.dir` set; status booleans all true (item 1). **Items 2–3 PASS:** steered frame under `identity/` with a correct `ip_adapter` sidecar block + char-relative reference; the pinned slash-form encoder folder loaded with no projection dim-mismatch. **Items 4–5 → a 12 GB finding + engine tuning:** the fully-resident identity stack peaked **12.18 GB (standard) / 12.32 GB (plus)** — past the card, silently WDDM-spilling to system RAM at **18.6 s/frame** (vs 9.7 base; base's 10.35 GB fits clean); the identity→base swap correctly freed the identity extras (−1.83 GB ≈ ViT-H+adapter) and release ends at 0.01 GB. Fix: below `IDENTITY_RESIDENT_VRAM_MIN_GB=14.0` the identity backend now uses accelerate **model-cpu-offload** (adapter loaded before device placement, diffusers' documented order) — re-measured peak **6.58 GB std / 6.01 GB plus, 12.0 s/frame** steady-state (faster than the spilled resident path); pure predicate `identity_needs_cpu_offload` unit-tested; base/catalog paths untouched. **Item 6 PASS (visual):** identity holds across 0.30/0.55/0.80/0.95 (same character by eye at every scale), the prompt owns pose/wardrobe at ≤0.55, 0.95 approaches the documented near-lock (reference composition wins, mild color-fringe); **the structural adult anchor + Layer-2 negative age anchors hold at 0.95** — every frame unambiguously adult; 0.55 default confirmed; observed: `plus` at the global 0.55 over-steers (color cast) — its band is 0.3–0.6/default 0.45. **Items 7–8 PASS:** with every Python socket hard-blocked (stricter than airplane mode) the full base→reference→steered path completed — after fetching the SDXL **pipeline-config skeleton** (stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0 configs+tokenizers, 3.1 MB, no weights) into `models/sdxl_config/` and setting `pipeline_config_dir` (pre-stages the Stage-7 bundling item; the first socket-blocked run correctly failed structured `{ok:false,kind:'engine'}` while `pipeline_config_dir` was unset, proving both the documented caveat and the bridge contract); re-render from the steered sidecar's seed+scale+reference across a full release/reload came back **pixel-identical** (also proves offload-path determinism). **Two wiring/calibration catches (the pin_hf_cache class):** (1) insightface `prepare()` used its default `det_thresh=0.5`, silently dropping faces BEFORE the configured `det_score_floor` — any floor tuned below 0.5 was a dead knob; now `detector_threshold()` mirrors the coerced floor ([0,1]-clamped at the use site), unit-tested. (2) **The 3c-gating finding:** photo-trained buffalo_l/ArcFace is at its margin on the WAI-Illustrious anime style — the reference detected at det 0.745 while of six steered same-character frames (visually confirmed identical) **three yielded no detection even at det 0.20**, the rest det 0.25–0.39, and same-character ArcFace cosine measured **0.35–0.58** vs the 0.50 same-person floor: as-calibrated the 3c cull would reject essentially every bootstrap candidate on this style. Candidate resolution recorded in `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` §10 (swap the `FaceEmbedder` real backend to imgutils CCIP + anime face detection behind the same Protocol — the abstraction was built for this); decision surfaced to the user before the 3c run. Docs: §7 VRAM-behavior section, §10 det-thresh + calibration notes. Closing the last §6 item the same day: base-mode same-seed re-render across a full release/reload came back **pixel-identical** — **Stage 3a flag CLEARED** with all eight §6 items PASS. **683 tests passing (1 skipped).** **Stage 3b hardware-validation flag CLEARED.**
- *(3c CCIP embedder swap + hardware validation — 2026-07-12)* Acting on the 3b calibration finding, the user approved swapping the `FaceEmbedder` real backend from buffalo_l/ArcFace to **imgutils CCIP + anime face detection** (option graded against keep-buffalo_l-and-tune and a hybrid). **Feasibility probed BEFORE rewiring, on the exact frames that broke ArcFace:** anime-YOLO detection 8/8 at conf 0.83–0.89 (buffalo_l: 3/6 no-detect); CCIP same-character cosine **0.63–0.82 vs 0.33** for a different-character control — the checked-in 0.50 floor splits the gap with ~0.15 margin on both sides, and `ccip_difference == (1 − cos)/2` EXACTLY on every measured pair, so the pure cull's cosine machinery, fakes, and floor knobs are all byte-unchanged; the swap is confined to the [HARDWARE] backend + factory + preflight (`_CcipEmbedder`; buffalo_l/FaceAnalysis now built ONLY when `face_swap_enabled`; preflight witnesses the default path via the classifier cache alone — `classifier_unavailable` before `face_models_missing`; licenses: ccip_onnx OpenRAIL, anime_face_detection MIT, the non-commercial insightface pair now confined to the optional swap path). `import app.imagegen.cull` stays sandbox-clean. **A second freeze-at-import offline leak found and fixed mid-validation (the pin_hf_cache class):** the BASE backend never set `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` (only the 3b identity backend did), so in the normal flow — first heavy import = base render — huggingface_hub froze OFFLINE=False process-wide and the bootstrap cull's cached-model resolutions made live etag requests (observed unauthenticated-hub warning). Now `engine.pin_hf_offline` runs at startup: hub pinned offline whenever the §2 posture is configured (`pipeline_config_dir` set), warm path preserved when unset; unit-tested, and the warning disappeared from all subsequent runs. **§11 validation (real checkpoint, real CCIP/WD14, scripted):** full 64-candidate bootstrap on a fresh character (8 + 28 + 28 via `more=True` accumulation) → **64/64 keep-rate** (similarity 0.613–0.836, zero content/quality/similarity/det/area rejects), grid of 12 proposed, VRAM 0.01 GB resident during every cull (unload-before-cull live), ~13–14.5 s/steered-frame incl. loads; top-ranked frames visually confirmed same-character and unambiguously adult; `confirm_vetted` promoted grid+top-kept = **20 frames** into `vetted/` (in the §6 15–30 band, `below_floor=False`, final-pixel re-screen passed) and the 3d dataset contract reads it; a socket-blocked end-to-end bootstrap (generate → unload → CCIP/WD14 cull) completed fully offline. `more=True`'s answer to §11 item 8: NOT routinely needed — keep-rate is ~100% on this style, the 64 default over-provisions comfortably. A killed mid-batch run also confirmed the crash posture (stale `models.active` reset at next startup; append-only candidates; the Stage-4 reconciliation deferred item gained a candidates-orphan sweep addendum). **REMAINING (named in the pending flags):** the Layer-2 false-negative recall check (user-directed) and the optional face-swap leg. **684 tests passing (1 skipped).**
- *(3d + 3e hardware validation — 2026-07-12)* Ran the §13 and §15 checklists end-to-end on the target machine. **3d setup:** kohya `sd-scripts` cloned to `models/sd-scripts` (rev `0128ca00`, 2026-07-08) with its OWN uv venv (its pins — diffusers 0.32/transformers 4.54 — are incompatible with the app venv; `lora_trainer_python` exists for exactly this) + torch 2.13+cu126 + bitsandbytes 0.49. **Three real [HARDWARE] contract catches, all fixed + regression-tested:** (1) the generated toml wrote `resolution` as an int, but toml values bypass argparse coercion and sd-scripts unconditionally `args.resolution.split(",")`s — now a quoted string; (2) sd-scripts logs bilingual text and a Windows non-console pipe defaults the child to cp1252 while `text=True` decodes with the locale codec in the parent — the subprocess now pins `PYTHONUTF8=1` + `encoding="utf-8", errors="replace"`; (3) the trainer inherits the app's pinned offline HF posture and sd-scripts loads the two CLIP **tokenizers** from the hub — prewarmed into the pinned cache (§13 item 1 documented); the failure surfaced as a structured `train_failed` fail-fast, live-proving §13 item 6's path. **Training:** 40-step smoke PASS (105 s; dataset laid out + cleaned by design; `has_lora` flipped; trigger `cfidafa4efa8344b`), then the full **1600-step quality run: 31.5 min, VRAM peak 9.86 of 12 GB (~2.4 GB headroom)** — THE 12 GB stress test clears at the §16 quality-max defaults, 114 MB LoRA `os.replace`d over the smoke artifact. **3e:** first catalog run surfaced two more catches — `peft` was never pinned (diffusers' `load_lora_weights` refuses without it; now in requirements-full 3a slice) and **diffusers 0.39's kohya converter has a te1/te2 regression** (empty text-encoder rank_dict → `IndexError` on a TE-carrying kohya LoRA). Resolution, both sides: the trainer toml now sets `network_train_unet_only = true` (standard SDXL identity practice, lower VRAM, kills the fragile surface) AND the engine's catalog backend degrades to the UNet-only key subset when the full load fails (legacy/foreign LoRAs; the UNet slice was hardware-verified to carry the identity — a 12-step probe render reproduced the character from a minimal prompt). **Full §15 run with the trained LoRA: 20/20 matrix cells kept (zero rejects, `incomplete=0`), 287 s, VRAM peak 10.51 GB, slot 0.01 GB after; identity visually confirmed across portrait/standing/sitting × expressions** — the CCIP cull kept full-body cells that ArcFace would have no-detected. **3f on the real catalog: 20/20 matted at ~1.1 s/frame CPU, second run fully idempotent (0/20 skipped-all)** — closing §17's real-catalog items; the two residuals (edge-quality over composite backgrounds → Stage 5; blocked-frame purge drill → pairs with the user-directed Layer-2 recall check) are named in the pending flags. **686 tests passing (1 skipped).** **Stage 3d and 3e hardware-validation flags CLEARED; 3f mostly-validated.**
- *(Stage 2 verification — 2026-07-10)* Ran a three-agent adversarial pass (backend red-team executing live attacks, front-end static review, DoD audit). Execution-confirmed findings, all fixed: **non-atomic option merge** let a malformed drop-in half-mutate a bundled group into a regioned anatomy slider with widened clamp bounds (fixed: files now apply atomically via staged copy — a bad file has zero effect); **uncaught `OverflowError`** from a huge JSON slider integer escaping to the bridge (fixed + isfinite guards both sides of clamp); **loader crash-to-startup-brick** from deeply-nested JSON (`RecursionError`) or a directory/unreadable file named `*.json` (fixed: resilient load catches broadly, skips non-files); **slider-KEY channel unfiltered** (fixed: record gate now covers slider keys); **contextual terms ("child", "forced") persisting as selection/tag values** because lone tokens can't trip proximity logic (fixed: discrete values now gated in strict prompt context); non-finite option bounds, merge type-coercion drift, option-override reordering, `prompt_ranges` validated at load. Front-end: reload now prunes stale state (vanished groups/options/kind flips), save has an in-flight guard (double-click created duplicates), number-input empty-string guard, client-side required checks, live-check response sequencing, anatomy-region open-state preserved across re-renders. Clean bills: CSP (no inline/eval/innerHTML), one-window rule, XSS discipline via `textContent`, age gate unbypassable (all 15+ probe variants), no path/store influence from any creator input, no partial files on failed create. DoD audited item-by-item: all MET. **378 tests passing; scripted live-window smoke (quick create → detailed create with free text → blocked-name rejection → disk verification) ALL PASS.** **Stage 2 marked DONE.**
